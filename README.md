# Blogging Platform

## Overview

The Blogging Platform is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage their own blog posts. It provides a user-friendly interface for readers to browse, view, and interact with the blog posts. The platform is built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and log out securely. Only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on their blog posts. They can create new posts, view existing ones, edit and update their posts, and delete posts they've created.
- **Pagination:** The blog posts are paginated, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of posts.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** Administrators have additional privileges, such as deleting any post, while regular users can only manage their own posts.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images to be used in their blog posts, making them visually appealing and engaging.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses React Router for handling navigation and Axios for making API calls to the backend.
- **Backend:** The backend is developed with Spring Boot, a powerful Java-based web application framework. It utilizes Spring Security for user authentication and Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database.
- **Database:** The application uses an SQL database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store user information, blog posts, and related data.
- **Styling:** CSS and/or SCSS is used for styling the user interface, and the design is responsive to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.
